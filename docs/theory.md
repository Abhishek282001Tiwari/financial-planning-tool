# Portfolio Theory Documentation

## Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

### Overview
Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz in 1952, is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk.

### Key Principles

1. **Risk-Return Tradeoff**
   - Higher returns typically require accepting higher risk
   - Risk can be measured by standard deviation of returns

2. **Diversification**
   - Combining assets with low correlation reduces overall portfolio risk
   - "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"

3. **Efficient Frontier**
   - The set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for each level of risk
   - Rational investors choose portfolios on the efficient frontier

### Age-Based Asset Allocation

#### Traditional Approach: Rule of 100
Equity Allocation % = 100 - Age

**Rationale:**
- Younger investors have more time to recover from market downturns
- Risk capacity decreases with age as investment horizon shortens
- Need for stable income increases approaching retirement
